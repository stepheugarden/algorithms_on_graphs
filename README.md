https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs

- Week 1:
  - *Graph decomposition*: depth first reachablity algorithm implemented
  - *Connected components*: get number of connected components in a graph
- Week 2:
  - *Checking graph for cycles*: depth first search with post sorting
  - *Topological ordering of DAGs*: dito
  - *Number of strongly connected components of directed graphs*: DFS with counter update in post sorting
- Week 3:
  - *Shortest path*: using breadth first search for minimal number of steps from one node to an other
  - *Bipartite graphs*: check if a graph is bipartite using BFS
- Week 4:
  - *Shortest path in weighted graph*: impementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
  - *Find negative cycles in directed weighted graph*: using DFS to initialize connected components and then solve the problem using the Bellman-Ford algorithm
  - *Currency exchange*: Bellman-Ford algorithm and DFS for finding exchange rates in a graph with possibly negative cycles
- Week 5:
  - *Minimal spanning tree*: implemented Kruskal's algorithm using set operations with path compression heuristics
  - *Clustering*: minimal distance between clusters using Kruskal's algorithm
- Week 6: Project advanced algorithms
